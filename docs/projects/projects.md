**Operator Learning Methods**

_Sep 2024 - Present_

Implementing various operator learning methods, particularly Neural Operator (and it's variants) to solve Partial Differential Equations. This method can learn mesh-free, infinite dimensional operators with neural networks. Different parameterizations of the integral kernel have led to variations of the original work. **Mesh invariance** allows us to train the network on a lower resolution dataset, yet yield great results on higher resolution test inputs.

**Differential Equation Solver Library**

_Sep 2024 - Present_

I'm building my own JAX based numerical solver for differential equations (inspired by <a href="https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/" style="text-decoration:none;text-decoration-style: none;">diffrax</a>). I hope to eventually expand it to include neural ODEs and SDEs.

**Existence, Uniqueness and Continuation of solutions for Functional Differential Equations**

_Jan 2024 - May 2024_

Worked under [Dr. MT Nair](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/m-thamban-nair/) on studying an article published in the American Mathematical Monthly, and derived elementary proofs of the results presented with an undergraduate student in mind. Explored the applications of the results on the **Volterra-Hammerstein Integro Differential Equation** and researched numerical methods to solve the same.

Some of the results still need proof-reading but you can see the disseration <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JDVSTNePzmIIM-nCAiihm3V1webU5-2D/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration:none;text-decoration-style: none;">here</a>.

**Reinforcement Learning for Drone Navigation in environments with dynamic obstacles**

_Jun 2023 - Aug 2023_

Worked under [Prof. Harikumar Kandath](https://sites.google.com/view/harikumar-kandath/home) at the Robotics Research Centre, IIIT-Hyderebad on studying the effects of time varying bias in the observation space in training UAV navigation in environments with dynamic obstacles. Used the PPO algorithm to train the agent.

**Project Kratos: Autonomous Subsystem**

_Sep 2022 - Apr 2023_

Was part of BITS Goa's Mars Rover competitive team, working as a member of the autonomous subsystem. Worked on real-time obstacle detection and avoidance using YOLOv3 and ROS based integration using darknet_ROS. Implemented GPS and magnetometer based navigation, localization and mapping to efficiently traverse between GPS coordinates.
