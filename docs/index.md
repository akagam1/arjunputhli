**Welcome!**

My name is Arjun Puthli and I'm a 4th year student at [BITS Pilani Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), pursuing a dual degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (w/ minor in Data Science).

I am particularly interested in Machine Learning, Numerical Analysis and Methods to solve systems of equations, and Functional Analysis. Multi-agent system coordination and navigation is another line of research I'm quite interested in, and I love reading up about work related to this field.

I'm currently quite fascinated by the concept of Operator Learning, and how we can leverage ideas from Machine Learning to approximate mappings between Infinite-Dimensional Vector Spaces. This has obvious applications in aproximating solutions of PDEs. Quite excited about this area of research as it's still relatively new! [This](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08481) is one of the foundational papers in this area, so do read it if you're interested.

I love reading (particularly fantasy and sci-fi books), and I hope to mantain some kind of blog about some of my favourite reads too! I'm also super into rock music. Honestly, I'm totally up to discuss anything related to any form of media. I've recently started putting some time into learning the guitar and the ukulele, so hopefully I'm able to maintain that routine :P
